## For the patent application

**Idea:** I am imagnining the main idea is to show a workflow that mixes optimization algorithms, automation setup as well as simulations.

I think it would be sufficient to show for the patent to show that-
- Optimization algorithms can guide simulations. Luis paper.
- Show that hardware can make as good experiments (if not better) than human experimenters.
    - A breath of NP can be made and overgrown under this.
- Finally, show that optimization can guide the experiments too and make as good NPs (if not better) than what human experts can make. 
We should also take the TEM of good bipyramids that the setup made. To show it can actually make good difficult particles!

**I think with the above-mentioned workflow will be able to give us the results for the patent soon without holding up other studies.**
